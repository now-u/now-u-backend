Modern slavery can take the form of human trafficking - the movement of people with the aim of exploiting them -  forced labour, domestic servitude and criminal, sexual and child exploitation. This dire situation has only been exacerbated further by the current pandemic, causing an increase in exploitation and a disruption to response efforts.\r\n\r\nBy joining this campaign, you can learn more about the struggles faced by survivors, support charities in their efforts to eliminate modern slavery, and facilitate advocacy to reduce the harm inflicted on those most vulnerable.\r\n",

Autistic people may have a range of behaviours and traits that could mean they need support with certain things. These include social communication and interaction challenges, repetitive and restrictive behaviour, sensory differences, special interests or hobbies, extreme anxiety, and experiencing regular meltdowns or shutdowns.\\nFor many autistic people and their families, the challenges they face have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdowns. By joining this campaign you can learn more about what life is like when you are autistic, help breakdown stereotypes and misconceptions surrounding autism, and ultimately support organisations working to help autistic people and their families, particularly during the pandemic. \r\n",

      "description": "Menstruation is a normal biological process for the 1.8 billion girls, women, transgender men and non-binary persons of reproductive age across the world, yet at least 500 million of those who menstruate worldwide lack proper access to menstrual hygiene facilities. This forces them to find alternative, often unhygienic, means to manage their period, placing them at increased risk of harmful infections. Furthermore, the current pandemic further exacerbates these challenges as those who menstruate are forced to prioritise other basic needs over safe menstrual products. \\nBy joining the campaign, you can learn more about these menstrual-related challenges, help to break down the harmful stigmas surrounding menstruation and facilitate advocacy to reduce period poverty.\\nWe have co-created this campaign with You Humanity, whose mission is to share stories of kindness and curate campaigns with a purpose and for the greater good. It is through one of these stories that they met Sylvia Khasoa Maina, founder of Simama na DADA Initiative, a period poverty charity in Kenya, who is currently facing difficulties with funding and the schools being closed till next year. This campaign is an opportunity for You Humanity to support Sylvia and her community, and amplify their story of positive change. ",

      "description": "A \u2018non-visible disability\u2019 is an umbrella term for any impairment that isn\u2019t easily visible to others. Some examples of these non-visible disabilities include chronic fatigue syndrome, cystic fibrosis, and diabetes, as well as various mental health conditions. Despite an estimated 70% of all disabilities in the UK being non-visible, one of the main barriers facing those with non-visible disabilities is lack of general awareness. The lack of public knowledge about non-visible disabilities means that people can be skeptical of their existence, often resulting in disabled people not being able to access the support they need. By joining this campaign you can learn about the range of non-visible disabilities, the effects they have on people living with them, and support charities that work towards improving life for people with non-visible disabilities. \n",
